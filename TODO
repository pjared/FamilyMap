Have taken out DB calls from the following services:
LoginService
Event/Person services


Priority:
    -Make sure that the getUserName and generations works in fillHandler
    -Once I finish fill, register needs to generate 4 generations of data for that new user
    -This should fix most of my test failures

FILL GENERATION:

Recursive call for making parents
Recurse(Person)
    -Make father
    -Make mother
    -Create Marriage(Father, mother) -> passing in personID

Initial person does not have a spouse
